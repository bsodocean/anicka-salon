Short ABOUT this project:

This was my first ever project as Freelance Developer, I created this very early on my career when I was just learning the basics.
I took pictures, created design, and created this page from ground up with basically no knowledge at that time.
This entire project took me about 2-3 months and it was a great learning experience. I started with having no idea what I am doing, and left with knowledge of basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript and other
important aspects that go into making a web page for a company. The website is no longer on the web, but you can still find it's business profile that I also created on google.
